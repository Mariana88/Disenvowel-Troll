# [Disemvowel Trolls](https://www.codewars.com/kata/<challenge name>)


Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.



removeVowels: Function
* Args: 1
  * string
* Return: string
  * A string which is the same as the input string but without the vowels (i.e. a, e, i, o and u)
* Behavior: Accepts a string, removes all its vowels and return a new string without vowels

## Constraints

This challenge was used to learn about objects and how to work with them. Therefore the following constraints were placed:
* Use at least one object
* do not use arrays
* do not use string index to (re)construct the string without vowels

## Language Features

List the language features used in your solution.

The focus of these exercises are to strengthen you problem solving skills, not to learn the newest ES6 tricks. When you have the choice between to different language features it is better to choose the option that is easiest to read, most common, or most consistent with the rest of your solution.  

Keeping track of the language features you use will enable you separate the problem solving strategy from the implementation.  Being aware of this difference will be an asset later on when you're faced with larger applications and popular frameworks.

## Learning Journal

Things I learned studying this problem:
* Iterating over an object
* Setting a property of an object
* Setting the value of an object's property.

New vocabulary:


Things I struggled with:
* Using quotes to indicate objects properties and values or not


My study goals and stragegies:
* How to efficiently check if a given value is present anywhere in an entire object (i.e. is a value of any of the object's properties)
